# Welcome to the Course! ðŸ‘‹

Before we begin, please download and install the following essential tools:

1. **Node.js** - Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en)

   - This will be our main runtime environment for JavaScript

2. **Postman** - Download from [postman.com/downloads](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

   - We'll use this to test our APIs and endpoints

3. **MongoDB Community Edition** - Download from [mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

   - This will be our database system

4. **MongoDB Compass** - Download from [mongodb.com/try/download/compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

   - A GUI tool to help visualize and interact with our MongoDB data

5. **Code Editor** - While you're free to use any code editor you prefer, I highly recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this course due to its excellent JavaScript/Node.js support and helpful extensions.

Once you have these installed, we'll be ready to start building amazing things together! Let me know if you need any help with the installation process.
